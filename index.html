<h2>4. How We Share Information</h2>

<p>Our goal is to provide you with the best services possible. Read more about how we share your data.</p>

<h3>With our service providers and partners</h3>

<p>We use your non-personally identifiable information (that is, information that does not itself identify you, such as device information) for targeted online marketing using tools such as Facebook Custom Audience to reach interested parties.</p>

<p>We do not require you to provide any contact information to download or use our product, we do not log or store your IP address, and we do not keep a log of your online activities. Therefore, we generally do not have personal information to share with law enforcement agencies, nor do we have data to provide in response to law enforcement requests.</p>

<h3>As required by law</h3>

<p>We may disclose your information if: (i) to comply with a lawful process such as a court order, subpoena or search warrant, government/law enforcement investigation, or other lawful requirement; (ii) in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or otherwise take action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud, or other wrongdoing; or (iii) to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of our company, our users, our employees, or others.</p>

<h2>5. Cross-Border Data Transfer</h2>

<p>The sharing of information referred to in Section 4 sometimes involves cross-border data transfers, such as to the United States and other jurisdictions. The United States, European Economic Area ("EEA") member countries and other countries have different laws. When your information is transferred from your country of residence to another country, the laws and regulations protecting your personal information in the country to which it is transferred may differ from those of the country in which you reside.</p>

<p>The European Commission has adopted model contractual clauses that provide safeguards for personal information transferred outside the EEA. We use these model clauses or other suitable safeguards to allow the transfer of data from the EEA to other countries.</p>

<h2>6. Device Permissions</h2>

<p>Mobile platforms have permission systems for certain types of device data and notifications, such as your location, and push notifications. Where applicable, you may change your device settings to consent or not to the collection of relevant information or the display of relevant notifications. Of course, in this case, some services may lose full functionality.</p>

<h2>7. How We Protect Your Information</h2>

<p>The security of your personal information is very important to us. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information provided to us, both during transmission and after we receive it. Your account information is password protected.</p>

<p>We make every effort to protect you from unauthorized access to, alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information. Like all technology companies, while we take steps to protect your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information will always remain secure.</p>

<p>We regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks and regularly review our information collection, storage and processing practices to update our physical, technical and organizational security measures.</p>

<p>We may suspend your use of all or part of the services without notice if we suspect or detect a security breach. If you believe that your account or information is no longer secure, please notify us immediately by email.</p>

<h2>8. How Long We Keep Your Information</h2>

<p>We will only retain your information for as long as necessary for the purposes set out in this policy, as long as your account is active or as necessary to provide services to you. We will also retain and use your information to the extent necessary.</p>

<h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>

<p>Our services are intended for a general audience over the age of 13 (or over the age of 16 if you live in the EEA).
